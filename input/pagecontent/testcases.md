### Test cases 

The tests assume that the server can accept code systems on the fly.
If servers do not accept code systems on the fly, server authors will have to 
adapt these tests by rewriting them for their own actual support code systems. 
Either way, servers that do SHOULD pass all the tests, but the FHIR product director 
will review the test outcomes in order to approve a server. 

The test cases are in version R5, but the tests will run against either an R4 or an R5 server. 
See [R4 and the Test Cases](r4.html)

#### Running the tests 

The tests can be run by any runner that processes the tests correctly, but the  easiest way to 
execute the tests is to use the [standard Java FHIR Validator](https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/releases).
Run with the parameters:

````
txTests -tx {server} -version? {version} -externals {file} -output {folder} -mode? {flat}?
````

Notes:
* server is the URL of the server to test for conformance 
* the version defaults to 'current' - the version of the tests in the ci-build of the this IG
* externals is a file that allows the server to use it's own messages - they don't have to match the tx.fhir.org messages. Just copy the file `tests/messages-tx.fhir.org.json` for the format.
* the output folder will default to your temporary directory. It produces output for the failed tests that you can compare with the /tests directory in the package for this IG with a comparison software of your choice (winmerge, beyondCompare, etc)
* modes - see below. you can pass in multiple modes if necessary, separated by commas 

#### Test Suites and Test Cases 

All the tests are registered in `tests/test-cases.json`, which contains a list of suites, 
each of which contains a list of tests. A suite may have:

* `name`: the name of the suite (used in the test output, and to run a single suite)
* `description`: what the suite is for
* `setup`: a list of files containing the resources (code systems, value sets, concept maps) 
  that the server needs in order to run the tests in the suite. Servers that cannot accept 
  resources on the fly have to load these some other way
* `mode` / `modes`: the suite only runs when the runner is in that mode (see below)
* `version`: the suite only runs against servers of that FHIR version (see below)
* `disabled`: if true, the suite is not run at all

A test may have:

* `name`: the name of the test, unique within the suite
* `description`: what the test is checking. This is the documentation for the requirement 
  the test enforces, so it should say why the expected response is the correct one
* `operation`: one of `expand`, `validate-code`, `cs-validate-code`, `lookup`, `translate`, 
  `compare`, `batch`, `batch-validate`, `metadata`, `term-caps`
* `request`: the file containing the request parameters (not used by `metadata` / `term-caps`)
* `response`: the file containing the expected response
* `request:{mode}` / `response:{mode}`: an alternative request or response used when the 
  runner is in that mode - e.g. `response:flat` for servers that return a flat expansion
* `mode` / `modes`, `version`, `disabled`: as for suites
* `http-code`: the expected HTTP status code, where it isn't 200 (e.g. `422`, or `4xx`)
* `lenient-display`: sets the `lenient-display-validation` parameter on a `validate-code` or 
  `cs-validate-code` request, so that the same request can be tested both ways
* `profile`: a file containing a Parameters resource with the expansion parameters to use
* `Accept-Language`: the language to ask for
* `header`: an additional HTTP header to send ( `name`, `value`, and optionally `mode`)

#### Versions 

The test cases are written in R5, and most of them are the same for an R4 server, but 
some questions have different answers in different versions of FHIR. Where a test only 
makes sense for particular versions, the `version` property says which:

* `"version" : "4.0"`: only run this against an R4 server (matches `4.0`, and any version 
  starting `4.0.`, so `4.0.1` matches)
* `"version" : "!4.0"`: run this against anything except an R4 server

Where the same test applies to all versions but the *response* differs, the difference is 
marked in the expected response with `$optional$` or `$only$` (see below).

#### Test Templates 

Expected responses are not compared literally - they are templates. A string in an expected 
response may be one of:

* `$$`: any value
* `$id$`, `$uuid$`, `$url$`, `$token$`, `$string$`, `$date$`, `$instant$`, `$semver$`: any 
  value of that kind. (`$string$` means any string that has no leading or trailing whitespace)
* `$version$`: the FHIR version of the server being tested. `$version$` is also substituted 
  into longer strings, so `"...|$version$"` works
* `$choice:a|b|c$`: any one of the listed values
* `$fragments:a|b$`: any string that contains all of the listed fragments (case insensitive). 
  This is how messages are checked where the exact wording is not fixed
* `$external:N$`: the string registered as `N` in the externals file, which lets a server 
  provide its own wording for a message. See `tests/messages-tx.fhir.org.json` for the format. 
  `$external:N:a|b$` also gives fragments to use when no externals file is provided

An object in an expected response may carry:

* `$optional-properties$`: an array of the names of properties that the server is allowed to 
  omit. `*` means all of them
* `$count-arrays$`: an array of the names of properties whose content is not checked - only 
  the number of entries in them
* `$optional$`: this object may be omitted (see below)
* `$only$`: this object is required in some versions or modes, and prohibited in the rest 
  (see below)

#### $optional$ and $only$ 

`$optional$` marks an entry in an array that the server does not have to return. It is either 
a boolean, or a filter that says when it is optional:

* `"$optional$" : true`: always optional. Note that this must be a boolean - `"true"` as a 
  string is read as a mode name, and does nothing
* `"$optional$" : "{mode}"`: optional unless the runner is in that mode
* `"$optional$" : "!{mode}"`: optional only when the runner is *not* in that mode. e.g. 
  `"!tx.fhir.org"` means "every server except tx.fhir.org may leave this out"
* `"$optional$" : "version:4"`: optional when the server's FHIR version starts with `4`
* `"$optional$" : "warning:{message}"`: always optional, but the runner reports the message 
  when the content is missing

`$only$` is the counterpart: where `$optional$` only ever relaxes a requirement, `$only$` 
says that the entry belongs to exactly one version or mode. When its filter passes the entry 
is required, and when it does not, the entry must **not** be present at all. The filter 
grammar is the same as `$optional$`'s. So `"$only$" : "version:4"` marks content that an R4 
server must return and an R5 server must not.

#### Modes 

Some tests, and some parts of expected responses, only apply to servers with particular 
characteristics, or to a particular server. These are marked with a mode, and only run 
when that mode is passed to the runner with the `-mode` parameter. `general` is always 
on unless it is turned off with `-mode !general`. The modes in use are:

* `general`: the tests every server is expected to pass. This is the default
* `snomed`: servers that support SNOMED CT, loaded with the test subontology described in 
  `tx-source/readme.md`
* `omop`: servers that support OMOP
* `icd-11`: servers that support ICD-11
* `tx.fhir.org`: tests that are specific to tx.fhir.org - either its own bugs, or operations 
  that are still being trialled there. No other server is expected to pass these
* `flat`: servers that return a flat expansion rather than a hierarchical one. This mode 
  selects the `response:flat` alternative for the tests that have one

A mode name can also appear in `$optional$` / `$only$` in an expected response, so that a 
particular server (or every server but one) is held to a different requirement than the rest 
- `"$optional$" : "!tx.fhir.org"` is used throughout for content that only tx.fhir.org is 
required to return.
